# Geo-spatial analysis using Python
cripts to solve complex, yet in modern geodata science common, problems in big data processing utilizing commonly used (geodata) libraries as GDAL, NumPy, and OGR. This project further includes the application of advanced raster/vector processing and machine learning techniques [GBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting), [SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine).
